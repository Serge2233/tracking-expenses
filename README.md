# Tracking Budget Expenses

### Description
This project is a budget tracker app that allows you to track your withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection. You will be able to receive a notification that you have added, an expense or deposit. When you reestablish your internet connection, then the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to your transaction history and your totals are updated.
